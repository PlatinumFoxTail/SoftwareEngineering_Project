# Retrospective

We used the Glad, Sad, Mad method. It helped us look at how everyone's doing and what needs to be fixed.

**Glad:**
- Our Wednesday meetings are productive and help us work together better.

**Sad:**
- We were not sure who should do what. This made things a bit slower and confusing.
- Building the project is too complicated.
  
## Solutions:
- Remote Work Slot on Day Level:
  - This helps us talk better and work together more smoothly.
- Task Division:
  - Better understanding of each team member's responsibilities.
- Simplify Project Building:
  - Create scripts to make the project building process easier.

## Summary:
All in all everything's going pretty nicely! Let's implement the solutions and keep up the good work.
