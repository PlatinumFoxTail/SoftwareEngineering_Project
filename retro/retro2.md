# Retrospective 2

We used the Glad, Sad, Mad method. It helped us look at how everyone's doing and what needs to be fixed.

**Glad:**
- Sampo: proactivity.
- Jouni: discord status channel & invoke scripts.
- Tarvo: task division & communication is better now.
- Martin: team speed, accuracy.
- Ismo: the communication is good and the invoke scripts make life easier

**Sad (or mad):**
- Jouni: not sure what others are doing
- Tarvo: remote work slot is not that good right now.
- Martin: feeling of own contribution being limited + not sure what others are doing.

## Solutions:
- Use discord status channel to let others know what you're doing.
- Leave comments or explain if you make changes that are not obvious.
- Add invoke scripts to README.md.

## Summary:
Keep up the good work!
