# Retrospective 3

We used the Glad, Sad, Mad method. It helped us look at how everyone's doing and what needs to be fixed.

**Glad:**
- Martin: Same as others + Martin contributed more than last sprint.
- Sampo: Velocity solution. Efficient solutions instead of inventing the wheel again e.g. Bibtex ready solution.
- Tarvo: Velocity good in sprint. Communication good due to Discord. Good task breakdown.
- Jouni: Good workflow, things proceed well.

**Sad (or mad):**
- Martin: Pr from branch to main not so smooth -> main git pull, git checkout branch, merge origin, git push / rebase
- Jouni: Splitting of tasks maybe to specific at the time e.g. could be vertical tasks rom frontend -> backend.
- Sampo: Too much time spent on configuration. Team though appreciate it!
- Tarvo: Last minute needed to fix a task that was still open.

## Solutions:
- If something left open in communication just resend message again in Discord
- Mark in backlog one responsible person and rest working on task in paranthesis

## Summary:
Keep up the good work!
